                    <p class="intro">
                        Australia is a nation shaped by <strong>migration, language, and growth</strong>. Over the past
                        two decades, the population has surged not just in size but also in the
                        <strong>rich mix of cultures and languages</strong> that call it home. From the bustling,
                        multilingual cities of <span class="highlight nsw">New South Wales</span> and
                        <span class="highlight vic">Victoria</span>
                        to the quieter communities of

                        <span class="highlight nt">Northern Territory</span>, every state tells a different story.

                                The map illustrates the percentage of Australians who
                                <strong>speak a language other than English at home</strong>, shaded using an
                                <strong>orange gradient</strong> where darker tones represent higher proportions of
                                non-English speakers. The <span class="highlight nt">Northern Territory</span> records
                                the highest proportion, reflecting the region’s strong
                                <strong>Indigenous language presence</strong> alongside smaller migrant communities.
                                <span class="highlight vic">Victoria</span> follows closely, driven by
                                <strong>Melbourne’s diverse migrant population</strong> while

                                <strong>moderate diversity</strong>, whereas
                                <span class="highlight tas">Tasmania</span> has the
                                <strong>lowest proportions of non-English speakers</strong>. Overall, the distribution

                                <strong>urbanisation, Indigenous heritageand international migration</strong>
                                together shape Australia’s evolving cultural and language landscape.

                                The treemap visualises the <strong>religious affiliations of Australians</strong>.
                                <span style="color: #8b4513; font-weight: 600">Christianity</span> remains the largest
                                religious category with <strong>Catholicism</strong> forming the biggest segment within
                                it. This reflects Australia’s historical ties to
                                <strong>European settlement and Christian traditions</strong> that continue to influence
                                cultural and community life today.

                                now occupies almost as much space as Christianity overall which is a striking sign of
                                <strong>Australia’s growing secularisation</strong>. Younger generations increasingly
                                identify as having no religious affiliation due to being influenced by
                                <strong>social liberalism, education and cultural diversity</strong>.

                                            This drop reflects in the <strong>halt of overseas migration</strong> which
                                            is a key driver of population growth in Sydney and Melbourne as well as
                                            <strong>domestic relocation</strong> as residents moved from large
                                            metropolitan areas to smaller states seeking affordability, lifestyle

                                            growth resumed which shows the strong role that
                                            <strong>migrant inflows and inter-state mobility</strong> play in shaping
                                            Australia’s demographic landscape.

                                            is <strong>30–34 years</strong>, reflecting Australia’s strong working age

                                            Population numbers gradually decline with increasing age, with noticeable
                                            drops from the <strong>70–74 years</strong> range onward. The smallest group
                                            is those aged <strong>85 years and over</strong> which highlights the
                                            natural effects of ageing and mortality despite an overall
                                            <strong>increasing life expectancy</strong>. The pattern emphasises
                                            Australia’s continued reliance on
                                            <strong>younger adults and migrants</strong> to sustain its workforce and
                                            support an ageing population.
